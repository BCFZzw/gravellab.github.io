## Simon Gravel

<!--- <img align="left" src="/images/photo_simon.jpg" style="width:100px;height:160p"/> --->
I try to understand the relationship between genetic diversity, history, biology, and disease. I often do this through mathematics and statistics, and collaborations with people who know biology, history and anthropology. I am also scientific co-director of the [CARTaGENE cohort](https://cartagene.qc.ca/).

# Graduate students

## Alex Diaz-Papkovich

Alex graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BMath, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Pure Mathematics, and completed an MSc in Probability and Statistics at Carleton University. He was a rotation student in the lab in Winter 2018 as part of McGill University's Quantitative Life Sciences PhD program. He joined the lab fully in September 2018, focusing his research on dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis for biobanks.


# Alumni

## Luke Anderson-Trocme

Luke Anderson-Trocmé (PhD) is now a postdoctoral researcher working with John Novembre at the University of Chicago, specializing in the development of innovative data visualizations to depict the geographic distribution of genetic variation. Building on the skillsets honed during his PhD in the Gravel Lab and a background in environmental microbiology, Luke’s research on the French-Canadian population showcases his expertise in genealogy and population genetics. He continues to explore the connections between history, geography, and genetics to unravel the complexities of human ancestry.
