Simon Gravel is associate professor in the [Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/) at McGill University, with affiliations in Computer Science, Quantitive Biology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Physics. His graduate training was in Mathematics and Physics at the Université de Montréal and Cornell University, and did postdocs in Genetics in Cologne and Stanford universities. 

He tries to understand the relationship between genetic diversity, history, biology, and disease. A lot of his work is through mathematics and statistics, with collaborations with people who know biology, history and anthropology. He is also scientific co-director of the [CARTaGENE cohort](https://cartagene.qc.ca/).

# Postdoc

## Melissa Spear

Melissa is a postdoctoral fellow working jointly with Simon Gravel and Dara Torgerson (UCSF). She received her PhD in 2019 from UCSF in the lab of Ryan Hernandez, studying the role of recent demographic history in shaping patterns of genetic ancestry in Hispanic/Latino populations.  She is broadly interested in the evolutionary and historical processes that shape genetic diversity in admixed and underrepresented populations. In the group, Melissa co-leads the PopGen working group of the CAAPA consortium, which is focused on further understanding genetic diversity in populations of African descent. Outside of the lab, Melissa enjoys knitting, baking, and adding more books to her never ending stack of unread books.

# Graduate students

## Alex Diaz-Papkovich

Alex graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BMath, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Pure Mathematics, and completed an MSc in Probability and Statistics at Carleton University. He was a rotation student in the lab in Winter 2018 as part of McGill University's Quantitative Life Sciences PhD program. He joined the lab fully in September 2018, focusing his research on dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis for biobanks.

Luke Anderson-Trocmé (PhD) is now a postdoctoral researcher working with John Novembre at the 
University of Chicago, specializing in the development of innovative data visualizations to 
depict the geographic distribution of genetic variation. Building on the skillsets honed during 
his PhD in the Gravel Lab and a background in environmental microbiology, Luke’s research on the 
French-Canadian population showcases his expertise in genealogy and population genetics. He 
continues to explore the connections between history, geography, and genetics to unravel the 
complexities of human ancestry.
