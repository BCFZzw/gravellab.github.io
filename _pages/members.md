Simon Gravel is associate professor in the Department of Human Genetics at McGill University, with affiliations in Computer Science, Quantitive Biology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Physics. His graduate training was in Mathematics and Physics at the Université de Montréal and Cornell University, and did postdocs in Genetics in Cologne and Standord universities. 

He tries to understand the relationship between genetic diversity, history, biology, and disease. A lot of his work is through mathematics and statistics, with collaborations with people who know biology, history and anthropology. He is also scientific co-director of the [CARTaGENE cohort](https://cartagene.qc.ca/).

## Alex Diaz-Papkovich

Alex graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BMath, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Pure Mathematics, and completed an MSc in Probability and Statistics at Carleton University. He was a rotation student in the lab in Winter 2018 as part of McGill University's Quantitative Life Sciences PhD program. He joined the lab fully in September 2018, focusing his research on dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis for biobanks.

## Luke Anderson-Trocmé <a href="https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-github zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeAnderTroc"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
Luke Anderson-Trocmé (PhD) is now a postdoctoral researcher working with John Novembre at the 
University of Chicago, specializing in the development of innovative data visualizations to 
depict the geographic distribution of genetic variation. Building on the skillsets honed during 
his PhD in the Gravel Lab and a background in environmental microbiology, Luke’s research on the 
French-Canadian population showcases his expertise in genealogy and population genetics. He 
continues to explore the connections between history, geography, and genetics to unravel the 
complexities of human ancestry.
