Welcome! 

Our lab is interested in population genetics. That is, we try to understand genetic variation across individuals, and its ties to biology, evolution, and disease. 

We do this mostly by developing mathematical and statistical tools, and by applying such methods to genetic datasets. 

Prospective trainees should have a look at the sample projects folder and contact gravellab@gmail.com with questions and applications.
