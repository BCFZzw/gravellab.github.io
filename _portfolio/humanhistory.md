Genetic diversity comes from past mutations inherited via the densely woven human family tree. 
We do not have access to this family tree, but can learn the broad strokes of human demography and migrations by building mathematical models that encode historical models and predict relatedness patterns among contemporary individuals. This project involves both mathematical methods development and applications to large datasets.
